# Vizualize-3D-Tomography
Simple tool to visualize a 3D image volume (like tomography data) in MATLAB for viewing and probing.

User will need to download both the '.m' and '.fig' and place them in the directory for use. Alternatively, user can place them in Documents>MATLAB to access them from any path when using MATLAB.

This program requires an input to be a 2 3D matrix (stacked tomograms) and outputs a figure with a slider bar to progress through slices in the 3D image volume.
