# Vizualize-3D-Images
Simple tool to visualize a 3D image volume (like tomography data) in MATLAB for viewing and probing.

User will need to download both the '.m' and '.fig' and place them in the directory for use. Alternatively, user can place them in Documents>MATLAB to access them from any path when using MATLAB.

This program requires an input to be a two 3D matrices (like stacked tomograms and stacked post-processed tomograms) and outputs a figure with slider bars and viewing options to view slices in the 3D image volumes. The two input matrices can be identical.

Confirmed - runs on MATLAB 2017 and 2018, may not run successfully on earlier versions of Matlab
